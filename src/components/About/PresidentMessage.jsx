          Greetings fellow engineering students! It is a privilege to serve as
          the president of this dynamic body. Our mission is to uphold academic
          excellence, foster collaboration, and create a community where every
          engineer has the tools to succeed.
        </p>
        <p className='text-gray-700 text-base md:text-lg mb-4 leading-relaxed'>
          NUESA is more than a union â€” it is a family, a force, and a future. I
          encourage every student to get involved, contribute, and grow with us.
          Together, we engineer greatness.
        </p>
