    title: "Countdown to the NUESA Elections!",
    category: "News",
    excerpt: "Get ready! The NUESA elections are approaching, and it's time for students to choose the next leaders for 2026/2027.",
    content: `The buzz is real! NUESA elections are almost here! It’s that exciting time of the year when engineering students get to decide the next set of leaders who will drive our college forward.

The elections mark an important moment for the College of Engineering, giving students the chance to elect representatives who will shape the direction of NUESA in the 2026/2027 administration.

Across all nine departments, conversations are already bubbling, (though in hushed tones) among potential candidates. Each one is sharing their vision with close comrades, carefully evaluating strategies, and planning the best ways to win.

But this election isn’t just about who wins. It’s about choosing people who will represent us, listen to our concerns, and make real things happen. Whether it’s improving academics, boosting welfare, or creating more engaging activities, every candidate brings something unique to the table.

The electoral process, headed by the Independent NUESA Electoral Committee, is being organized to ensure transparency, fairness, and active participation from all engineering students.

As we count down to election day, NUESA remains committed to upholding its values of accountability, service, and excellence. Every vote counts, and students are encouraged to participate fully in deciding the future of our association.

Your vote matters. Your choice shapes NUESA. 💚`,
